`Obsidian`'s notes on swapping A BRZ's steering column & electric steering into a bugeye:

This is super helpful, but I don't plan on swapping the steering column.

`Synapsis` swapping a 2015 WRX rack into a 2010 STi:

Of particular note, part of this swap involved putting the 2015 crossmember in the 2010 STi with minimal modification. This could offer a critical solution for prepping the RS for an FA24 and a valuable first-step to make things a little easier. It's also important to note that this could be a good intro to CAN bus and would be the first CAN device in the car, albeit standalone and not actually on a network. Baby steps!

Looks like Unabomber did something very similar:

Current major dilemma/question: Do I source an OEM crossmember, modify my existing crossmember, or buy something custom (TSS)? TSS would be sooooo coooooool...but pricey :( so I'd prefer something OEM-y.

Based on Synapsis, Unabomber, and general knowledge of GC swaps, the following should be true:

```
IF a VA (2015) WRX crossmember fits a GV (2010) STI
AND a (GV) 2013 STI crossmember can be fit to a 2004 (GD) WRX wagon, 
THEN the 2015 crossmember should fit a GC
```
