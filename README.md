Modernizing a 2000 Subaru Impreza 2.5 RS

Just a quick place to take some notes.
Link to iWire's notes on an FA swap and why it's a terrible idea:
https://www.iwireservices.com/post/fa20-engine-swap

One of the issues they encountered was that FA cars don't have hydralic steering systems. They opted to replace the A/C compressor with a power steering pump. I'm too much of a pansy, so I'm going to convert my GC to electric steering.

TO DO:
- Isolate the cabin from the trunk. Fiberglass sheet with MLV?
- Repair or replace steering wheel
- Replace carpet
- Replace HVAC w/ unit out of a GMC Canyon, adapted to fit Subaru center console. GM part number is 84042940.
- Coilovers
- Amber foglights
- Paint 16" rims gold
- Upgrade stereo (new speakers, add subwoofer, add/upgrade tweeters, Upgrade to touchscreen BT -maybe-)
- New upholstery (new seats?)
- New shift knob
- Convert to 6 speed
- FA24 Swap
- Exterior paint
- Repair sunroof
- Fix air leaks
