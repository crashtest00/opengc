Modernizing a 2000 Subaru Impreza 2.5 RS

Just a quick place to take some notes.
Link to iWire's notes on an FA swap and why it's a terrible idea:

One of the issues they encountered was that FA cars don't have hydralic steering systems. They opted to replace the A/C compressor with a power steering pump. I'm too much of a pansy, so I'm going to convert my GC to electric steering.
