Synapsis swapping a 2015 WRX rack into a 2010 STi: 
https://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2733605
Of particular note, part of this swap involved putting the 2015 crossmember in the 2010 STi with minimal modification. This could offer a critical solution for prepping the RS for an FA24 and a valuable first-step to make things a little easier. It's also important to note that this could be a good intro to CAN bus and would be the first CAN device in the car, albeit standalone and not actually on a network. Baby steps!
