# Interior Upgrades
The goal for this is to make the car feel like it could have been made in the last couple of years. Here's what I'd like to do:
* Repair center console storage compartment
* Fix air leaks at side mirrors
* Replace window pads & [polish glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YeARS4hfJ8&ab_channel=WadeHGarrett)
* Replace driver's seatbelt
* Repair steering wheel (Redline kit?) or replace
* Replace carpet. I'd like to go to black and I'll probably source from Zealous Interiors or Stock Interiors.
* Upgrade dash cubby lid (cellphone holder, lid lift assist)
* Update wipers to have more than one interval setting (!!!)
* Replace front seats (rears too?)
* Reupholster rear seats to match front
* Reupholster door cards and insets to match seats
* New gauges?
* Replace existing HVAC with an auto unit. I really what GMC is putting in the Canyon. Part number is 84042940, although I'll probably need some other stuff too. Could be a good way to dip my toes into CAN bus.
