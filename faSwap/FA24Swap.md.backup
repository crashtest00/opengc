# Swapping an FA24 into a GC
*Technically a GM6*

Why? Because I believe it can be done at great labor and great expense. More importantly, I think I'll have a lot of fun along the way. And I kinda like the bragging rights of owning the only 2.**4**RS in the world.

iWire guys are very smart. They said it shouldn't be attempted for at least a few more years:
https://www.iwireservices.com/post/fa20-engine-swap. Of course, that was in July of 2020 so obvs August 2021 is much better...Also, they were talking about an FA20 and this is totally different.

Except it's not. It's worse.

Now that we have that out of the way:
Prime Motoring swapped an FA24 into a Crosstrek using an FA20 ECU and was able to tune it using  an Accessport.

The plan is to buy a wrecked Ascent and swap *as much as possible* to the GC, right down to the door locks if necessary. Might also be work looking into how hard it would be to hack up the Ascent gauge cluster to fit in the GC dash...
