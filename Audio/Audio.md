# Audio Upgrades
This includes stereo and soundproofing. 

## Audio
### Speakers:
* Kicker 46CSS654 (Front)
* Kicker CSC65 (Rear)
* Blaupunkt GTHS80
### Headunit:
TBD. Some sort of computer though. Here are the requirements:
* Access the car's CAN bus with the ability to monitor all posted CAN messages in a user-friendly GUI.
* Log engine/ECU data and save internal flash accessible via USB or other method. Preferably not SD card...
* Native Bluetooth.
* Native streaming client using a phone's hotspot?
## Soundproofing
* The existing "isolation" between the cabin and the trunk consists of the rear seat back and a sheet of "waffle plastic". I'm considering replacing this with some sort of fabbed fiberglass panel and MLV.
* Dynamat inside doors and on floor plans. 
* Add soundproof padding under the carpet
